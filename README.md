Leandra's technical test for Vigorate
See page live <a href="https://leandrar.github.io/vigorate/">here</a>

I chose to use Sass to compile the CSS, allowing for modularization of the code.

I used normalize.css to help ensure the format will render properly in different browsers (and did cross-browser testing).
